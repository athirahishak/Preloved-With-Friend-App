# Preloved With Friend App

## Description
The Preloved With Friend App is a platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of preloved clothing. Our mission is to promote sustainable fashion by making it easy for users to give their gently used clothes a second life while finding unique pieces at affordable prices.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Our app offers a clean and intuitive design, making it easy for users to navigate and find what theyâ€™re looking for.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can quickly search for items using our advanced search bar, which allows for filtering by categories, sizes, and brands.
- **Seller Dashboard**: Sellers can manage their listings, view sales analytics, and communicate with buyers directly through the app.
- **Secure Payment Gateway**: Transactions are safe and secure, ensuring peace of mind for both buyers and sellers.

## Design and Development
The app's design is created using **Figma**, a powerful design tool that helps in crafting visually appealing user interfaces. Figma allows us to collaborate on designs and gather feedback efficiently before implementation.

For the development of the app and website, we use **Wix**, which provides a robust platform for building dynamic web applications. Wix enables us to easily customize our site, manage our inventory, and provide an engaging shopping experience for users.
